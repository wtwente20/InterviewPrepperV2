# InterviewPrepperV2

I was originally building InterviewPrepper but realized I had built the database via MongoDB in a really funky way
so I decided to go back and rebuild again from scratch. While this measure seems drastic, I built the database
completely rather than adding to it on the go. My belief is that this new database setup with MySQL is more fine tuned
and more ready to handle the data exchanges this application will need to perform. I feel I rushed into InterviewPrepper
too fast and caused myself a lot of confusion, so I'd like to rebuild the entire thing as I am learning React and 
ExpressJS and would like to make sure I have a good foundation to work with. My goal is to go back and do everything
to reinforce the concepts I've been practicing within this app development.
